# Overview
This Sprint 1 is about modifying the database tables users and create a new table called posts. Where we have added new fields in the users table and the data is being modified in the database through profile edit page as well as we have added the dummy hardcoded data to the posts table using the database-data.sql file and displayed that data in the index page when the user loggs in to the application.

This sprint 2 is about modifying the database tables for creating posts and comments in the mini facebook application, also we have implemented few functionalities, where the user who is logged in can create a post, edit a post which is created by the logged in user, send a comment to a post which is created by other users. The minifacebook application is now css integrated for intuitive user experience.
